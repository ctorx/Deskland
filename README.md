# Deskland Preview

**Adaptive Windows wallpaper that makes your desktop icons part of the scenery.**

Deskland turns the space around your icons into a living landscape. Move, add or remove an icon and the beach, meadow, clouds and shadows quietly reshape around it — in real time, without AI, an account or an API key.

This is a free, locally built fork. It includes the **Beach** and **Meadow** themes, the Windows host, settings and sharing tools.

## Included themes

| Beach | Meadow |
| --- | --- |
| ![Beach theme](prototype/thumbs/beach.webp) | ![Meadow theme](prototype/thumbs/meadow.webp) |
| Turquoise waves, kayaks, seabirds and coconut palms. | Drifting clouds and shadows, a boy flying a kite and a little black cat. |

## Features

- **Adaptive scenery:** uses the real positions of desktop icons and transitions smoothly when they move.
- **Two complete themes:** every setting for Beach and Meadow is included and saved between sessions.
- **Made for the desktop:** tray controls, startup on sign-in and automatic pause when a window is maximized or full-screen.
- **Private sharing:** image and animation exports use sample icons and color blocks, never a screenshot of your desktop or real file names.
- **Independent installation:** Preview uses its own install directory, settings, startup entry and instance identity, so it can coexist with other Deskland builds.
- **No accounts or online services:** no sign-in, purchase restoration, update service or store API is included.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11, 64-bit.
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime.
- PowerShell and the .NET Framework C# compiler included with Windows; no .NET SDK installation is required.
- An internet connection for the first build, which downloads the WebView2 development library.
- Node.js only if you want to run the browser preview.

Currently, Deskland renders on the **primary monitor** and targets 30 fps on integrated graphics.

## Build from source

Open PowerShell in the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File host\build.ps1
host\bin\Deskland.exe
```

Keep `host/` and `prototype/` together. Build output is written to `host/bin/`.

Run the program again or double-click its tray icon to open Settings. To exit and restore the original Windows wallpaper, use the tray menu or run:

```powershell
host\bin\Deskland.exe --exit
```

Preview settings and logs are stored separately in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DesklandPreview`.

## Browser preview

```powershell
node prototype\serve.mjs
```

Open **http://localhost:5178/settings.html**. The browser uses sample icons; adaptation to real desktop icons requires the Windows host.

## Windows installer

Build the NSIS installer without installing global development tools:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build-installer.ps1
```

The first build downloads portable NSIS and Microsoft's WebView2 bootstrapper. Artifacts are written to `dist/` with SHA256 checksums and a matching source ZIP.

The installer targets the current user's `Programs\Deskland Preview` directory and does not require administrator rights. If WebView2 is missing, its bootstrapper requires an internet connection. Uninstalling preserves user settings.

[Download Deskland Preview for Windows](https://github.com/BLEZZ0102/Deskland/releases/latest). The installer is unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may show a warning.

## Project layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `host/` | Windows host, build scripts and application manifest |

| `tools/` | Installer build tooling |

## Known limitations

- Only the primary monitor is supported.
- Windows Spotlight or a wallpaper slideshow can briefly flash when Windows changes the background image.
- There is no account sign-in or automatic update.
